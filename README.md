# VirtualTap

Code and design files will appear here one day !

## Servo emulator

This is only useful if you wish to consolize your VirtualBoy and get rid of the mechanical parts to make it smaller.

The servo emulator makes the VirtualBoy think the eye displays are still there and working properly.

You only need to program a cheap microcontroler with this code and wire it up to the VirtualBoy's main board.

Porting the code to the Arduino Nano or other small AVR boards should be pretty straightforward.
