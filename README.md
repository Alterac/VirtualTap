Code and design fils will appear here one day !

## Servo emulator

If you wish to consolize your VirtualBoy and get rid of the mechanical parts to make it smaller, you need to simulate the servo board signals so that games can work.

You only need to program a cheap microcontroler with this code and wire it up to the VirtualBoy's main board.

This makes the VirtualBoy think the eye displays are still there and working properly.
